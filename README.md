# Lightning Rust Webhook Library

This library includes support for both `BTCPay` and `LNbit` webhooks. There are example projects for each provider, which you can use to get started. If desired, you can actually use the same server to handle both `BTCPay` and `LNbit` webhook callbacks.

Keep in mind this is an early (untagged) release, and it's not well tested in production. The library types and implimentation may change as I simplify to make this library more useful for general projects.
